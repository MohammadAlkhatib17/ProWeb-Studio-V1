# ProWeb Studio Deployment Checklist

This checklist covers all stages for performance, SEO, security, and deployment optimization.

## Constraints & Guardrails
- ❌ Do NOT modify any 3D models, materials, colors, or visual layout
- ❌ Do NOT add new pages or routes  
- ❌ Keep the site's design intact; changes limited to performance, SEO, security headers, and deploy/runtime configs
- ✅ Keep commits atomic: one commit per stage with clear message
- ✅ Use TypeScript strictness; no eslint/type errors allowed

## Stage 0: Preflight & Setup
- [x] Verify Node version configuration (.nvmrc + package.json engines)
- [x] Run `npm ci` - clean dependency installation
- [x] Run `npm run typecheck` - verify TypeScript compilation
- [x] Run `npm run lint` - identify existing linting issues
- [x] Confirm Next.js App Router structure (layout.tsx, page.tsx, API routes, OG route)
- [x] Create deployment checklist

## Stage 1: TypeScript & Linting Fixes
- [x] Fix `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` errors
- [x] Fix `@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type` errors  
- [x] Fix `@next/next/no-assign-module-variable` error
- [x] Fix `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings
- [x] Fix `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` error
- [x] Fix `react/no-unescaped-entities` error
- [x] Verify all lint issues resolved

## Stage 2: Security Headers & CSP
- [ ] Review and enhance Content Security Policy
- [ ] Add security headers middleware
- [ ] Configure HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- [ ] Test CSP compliance
- [ ] Verify security header implementation

## Stage 3: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Analyze current bundle size with `npm run bundle-stats`
- [ ] Optimize imports and dynamic loading
- [ ] Review and optimize images (next/image usage)
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring

## Stage 4: SEO Enhancement
- [ ] Audit existing metadata and structured data
- [ ] Enhance robots.txt and sitemap.xml
- [ ] Verify Open Graph and Twitter Card implementation
- [ ] Test SEO schema validation
- [ ] Optimize meta descriptions and titles

## Stage 5: Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Run Lighthouse performance audit
- [ ] Optimize Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- [ ] Minimize Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- [ ] Optimize First Input Delay (FID) / Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
- [ ] Verify Web Vitals scoring

## Stage 6: PWA Features
- [ ] Validate service worker implementation
- [ ] Test offline functionality
- [ ] Verify manifest.json configuration
- [ ] Test PWA installation flow
- [ ] Optimize app icons and splash screens

## Stage 7: Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] Verify Vercel Analytics integration
- [ ] Configure error tracking
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Test analytics data collection
- [ ] Configure alerts and dashboards

## Stage 8: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Perform cross-browser testing
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Validate accessibility compliance
- [ ] Load testing and stress testing

## Stage 9: Production Deployment
- [ ] Configure production environment variables
- [ ] Set up Vercel deployment configuration
- [ ] Configure custom domains and SSL
- [ ] Test production build locally
- [ ] Deploy to production and verify
- [ ] Post-deployment smoke testing

## Quality Gates
Each stage must pass before proceeding:
- ✅ No TypeScript errors (`npm run typecheck`)
- ✅ No ESLint errors (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ All tests passing (`npm run test`)
- ✅ Production build successful (`npm run build`)

## Notes
- All changes must maintain existing 3D functionality and visual design
- Performance improvements should not break existing animations or interactions
- Security enhancements must not interfere with legitimate functionality
- Each commit should be atomic and focused on a single stage
